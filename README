This software is based entirely on Gpredict, which is a real time satellite tracking and orbit prediction program for the Linux desktop. It uses SGP4/SDP4 propagation algorithms together with NORAD two-line element sets (TLE).

Along with the core features of Gpredict (please refer to http://gpredict.oz9aec.net for more information regarding Gprecit), this software also provides additional functionalities to:

- Track multiple satellites in a single view
- Calculate the Secret Key Rate based on the distance between two nodes (ground stations, satellites)
- Have many modules open at the same either in a notebook or in their own
  windows. The modules can also run in full-screen mode
- You can use many ground stations
- Predict upcoming passes
- Can run in real-time, simulated real-time (fast forward and
  backward), and manual time control
- Detailed information both the real time and non-real time modes

Requirements
------------

This software is written using the Gtk+ 3 widget set, which is available for most Unix like operating systems, Mac and Windows. Following libraries are required for successful compilation of the software:

- Gtk+ 3 or later
- GLib 2.32 or later
- GooCanvas 2
- Libcurl 7.16 or later
- Hamlib (runtime only, not required for build)

If you compile this software from source you will also need the development packages often with -dev or -devel in the package name, e.g. libgtk-3-dev. On Debian and Ubuntu systems you can install the build dependencies using:

  sudo apt install libtool intltool autoconf automake libcurl4-openssl-dev
  sudo apt install pkg-config libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libgoocanvas-2.0-dev


To build and install this software from source, first unpack the source package:

  tar -xvf gpredict-x.y.z.tar.gz

Then change to the gpredict-x.y.z directory and build the software:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

The last step usually requires you to become root, otherwise you may not have
the required permissions to install the software. If you can not or do not want to install the software as root, you can install the software into a custom directory by adding --prefix=somedir to the ./configure step. For example

  ./configure --prefix=/home/user/predict
  
will configure the build to install the files into /home/user/gpredict folder.

If you are building directly from the git repository, you have to run ./autogen.sh instead of of configure. You can pass the same options to the autogen.sh script as you would to the configure script.

If you want to know more about installation options refer to the INSTALL file (not for beginners).


Using this software
--------------

Gpredict comes bundled with some example data and will run "out of the box".
Once you got the idea of the UI, you can either modify the settings of the
default module (click on the small down-arrow in the top right corner), or
create a new module through File -> New Module.

You are highly encouraged to have a look at the user manual for Gpredict available at
http://gpredict.oz9aec.net/documents.php
